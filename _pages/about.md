👨‍💻I'm a final year graduate student in Ohio State University's Computer Science department.

🔬My research interests are parameter efficient fine-tuning techniques in LLMs.

📚I'mn currently finishing my Master's Thesis on Task Oriented Dialogue Systems.

👨‍💼I'm looking for full-time work opportunities in the field of Machine Learning / Data Science

# Selected Experience
🤖Co-led the university's team in the **Amazon Alexa Taskbot Challenge**. We developed a versatile and personalizable dialogue agent to assist users with Cooking & DIY tasks. We published our approach in the ACL/SIGDIAL 2023 conference (https://aclanthology.org/2023.sigdial-1.19/)

🏘️Created the **`Similar Homes` Recommendation System** at Compass to recommend house listings to users based on their preferences. I developed a scorer model that was used in a Learning-to-Rank style pipeline to generate house recommendations.

🧑🏻‍💼Created a **Sales Conversations Auto-Pilot** tool to assist sales agents drive sales conversations in a productive and streamlined manner. (https://www.salesken.ai/blog/signal-conversation-tracking)

# Projects
🤖**RLHF summary generation** - Created a Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback(RLHF) based text summarizer to remove toxic(offensive/bias) content from summaries. (https://github.com/iwinterknight/RLHF-Summary-Detoxifier)
Architected a novel cross-attention based network to generate summaries focusing on questions asked from the passage. (https://github.com/iwinterknight/LLMs_Cross_Task_Colab)

🏘️Created an end-to-end property recommendation system using LLM prompting for dialogue with user, and ElasticSearch to generate recommendations based on user preferences captured through the dialogue with the system. (https://github.com/iwinterknight/Property-Recommendation-System)
