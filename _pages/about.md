👨‍💻I'm a final year graduate student in Ohio State University's Computer Science department. Prior to this, I have **6 years of full-time work experience** in Machine Learning and Data Science roles.

🔬My research interests are in Natural Language Processing and Content Recommendation Systems. I have worked extensively with parameter efficient fine-tuning techniques(PEFT) in LLMs for downstream tasks in dialogue systems, and representation learning.

📚Check out my Master's Thesis on Task Oriented Dialogue Systems [here](/files/Sunit Singh - Master's Project Report.pdf).

# Selected Experience
🧑🏻‍💼**Machine Learning Engineer at Orbit Systems** : Created the NER-Engine to classify and annotate news articles with entities indicating useful leads for JobsOhio to approach businesses looking to invest and expand operations. Designed and developed asynchronous architecture using Apache Kafka to prompt large language model(GPT-4o) in a parallelized event micro-batching approach to tag continuous stream of scraped articles.

🤖**Research Associate at Ohio State University** : Co-led the university's team in the **Amazon Alexa Taskbot Challenge**. We developed a versatile and personalizable dialogue agent, hosted on AWS and deployed as an Alexa Skill, to assist users with Cooking & DIY tasks. We published our approach in the ACL/SIGDIAL 2023 conference [Publication](https://aclanthology.org/2023.sigdial-1.19/), [Github](https://github.com/iwinterknight/TacoBot)

🏘️**Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Compass** : Created the **`Similar Homes` Recommendation System** at [Compass](https://www.compass.com/for-rent/manhattan-ny/) to recommend house listings to users based on their preferences. I developed a scorer model that was used in a Learning-to-Rank style pipeline to generate house recommendations.

🧑🏻‍💼**Senior Data Scientist at Salesken** : Created a **Sales Conversations Auto-Pilot** tool to assist sales agents drive sales conversations in a productive and streamlined manner. [Blog](https://www.salesken.ai/blog/signal-conversation-tracking)

# Projects

📚**Knowledge Distillation for Dialogue QA** - Trained a specialist LLM model using knowledge distillation from open-source GPT 3.5 (ChatGPT) on task related QA dataset. Built RAG pipelines using `Parent Document Retriever` and `Contextual Compression Retriever` and performed TruLens evaluation for the RAG Triads(context relevance, groundedness and answer relevance) [GitHub](https://github.com/iwinterknight/Knowledge-Distillation-for-Dialogues-QA)

🤖**RLHF summary generation** - Created a Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback(RLHF) based text summarizer to remove toxic(offensive/bias) content from summaries. [GitHub](https://github.com/iwinterknight/RLHF-Summary-Detoxifier)
Architected a novel cross-attention based network to generate summaries focusing on questions asked from the passage. [GitHub](https://github.com/iwinterknight/LLMs_Cross_Task_Colab)

🏘️**LLM-Prompting/ElasticSearch based Recommendation System** - Created an end-to-end property recommendation system using LLM prompting for dialogue with user, and ElasticSearch to generate recommendations based on user preferences captured through the dialogue with the system. [GitHub](https://github.com/iwinterknight/Property-Recommendation-System)

🗄️**Comprehensive Study of Modern Data Analytics and Storage Engines** - Performed a detailed comparitive study of 10 state-of-the-art data analytics and storage engines used as commercial big data warehousing and data processing solutions. [Report](/files/DatabaseSystems.pdf)
