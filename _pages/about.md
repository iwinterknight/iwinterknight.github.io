👨‍💻I'm a final year graduate student in Ohio State University's Computer Science department.

🔬My research interests are in Natural Language Processing and Content Recommendation Systems. I have worked extensively with parameter efficient fine-tuning techniques(PEFT) in LLMs for downstream tasks in dialogue agents, and representation learning.

📚I'm currently finishing my Master's Thesis on Task Oriented Dialogue Systems.

👨‍💼I'm looking for full-time work opportunities in the field of Machine Learning / Data Science from May 2024 !

# Selected Experience
🤖**Research Associate at Ohio State University** : Co-led the university's team in the **Amazon Alexa Taskbot Challenge**. We developed a versatile and personalizable dialogue agent to assist users with Cooking & DIY tasks. We published our approach in the ACL/SIGDIAL 2023 conference [Publication](https://aclanthology.org/2023.sigdial-1.19/), [Github](https://github.com/iwinterknight/TacoBot)

🏘️**Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Compass** : Created the **`Similar Homes` Recommendation System** at [Compass](https://www.compass.com/for-rent/manhattan-ny/) to recommend house listings to users based on their preferences. I developed a scorer model that was used in a Learning-to-Rank style pipeline to generate house recommendations.

🧑🏻‍💼**Senior Data Scientist at Salesken** : Created a **Sales Conversations Auto-Pilot** tool to assist sales agents drive sales conversations in a productive and streamlined manner. [Blog](https://www.salesken.ai/blog/signal-conversation-tracking)

# Projects
🤖**RLHF summary generation** - Created a Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback(RLHF) based text summarizer to remove toxic(offensive/bias) content from summaries. [GitHub](https://github.com/iwinterknight/RLHF-Summary-Detoxifier)
Architected a novel cross-attention based network to generate summaries focusing on questions asked from the passage. [GitHub](https://github.com/iwinterknight/LLMs_Cross_Task_Colab)

🏘️**LLM-Prompting/ElasticSearch based Recommendation System** - Created an end-to-end property recommendation system using LLM prompting for dialogue with user, and ElasticSearch to generate recommendations based on user preferences captured through the dialogue with the system. [GitHub](https://github.com/iwinterknight/Property-Recommendation-System)

🗄️**Comprehensive Study of Modern Data Analytics and Storage Engines** - Performed a detailed comparitive study of 10 state-of-the-art data analytics and storage engines used as commercial big data warehousing and data processing solutions. [Report](/files/DatabaseSystems.pdf)
